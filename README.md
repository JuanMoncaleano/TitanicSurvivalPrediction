# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Description

The sinking of the Titanic on April 15, 1912, is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history, leading to the loss of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. Using a Titanic fatality dataset, this project aims to leverage machine learning models to determine the likelihood of survival for passengers on board. By building a predictive model, we aim to identify the types of individuals who were more likely to survive, taking into account various passenger data such as name, age, gender, socio-economic class, and more. This analysis serves as a compelling case study for understanding the dynamics that influenced survival rates during this tragic event.
